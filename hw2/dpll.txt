DPLL Algorithm
The DPLL algorithm is a back-tracking searching algorithm for solving
CNF SAT problems. The algorithm takes in a set of clauses and returns a bool.

Pseudocode

bool dpll(C):
  if (C is empty):
    return True
  while(there is a unit clause or literal p):
    if(p and not p are in C):
      return False
    else:
      C = Simplify (C, p)
  if(C is empty):
    return True

  pick p from shortest clause in C
  if(dpll(Simplify(C,p))):
    return True
  else:
    return dpll(Simplify(C, not p))

clause Simplify(C,p):
    delete every clause/literal in S containing p;
    delete every occurrence in S of ~p;
    return(S);
